I read the assignement as it was i PWA web app that was needed. Since i have not tried to set one up, and make one, the challenge seemed very steep.
I used:
1. Vue-cli to setup a PWA setup
2. Scoped scss/sass, wich took some time to get to work.
3. EsLint to lint the script. Wich kept bugging, and made it impossible to build the setup.
4. Typescript, though due to luck of time, and late late hours, it's really i mush of js and ts.
5. Serviceworker, wich i sadly did not get to work optimally to save data on the device.
6. Vue-router to setup the routing for the SPA.

All in all, i would call it a failure, due to me simply misunderstanding the assignement. 

The only code copied, was the reboot.css to scrape som of the worst browser defaults.
Rest is my attempt at trying to make the assignement in time, though to no avail.
