I read the assignement as it was i PWA web app that was needed. Since i have not tried to set one up, and make one, the challenge seemed very steep.
I used:
1. Vue-cli to setup the app.
2. Scoped scss/sass, wich took some time to get to work.
3. EsLint to lint the script. Wich kept bugging, and made it impossible to build the setup.
4. Typescript.
6. Vue-router to setup the routing, though not used.
