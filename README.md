I read the assignement as it was i PWA web app that was needed. Since i have not tried to set one up, and make one, the challenge seemed very steep.
I used:
1. Vue-cli to setup the app.
2. Scoped scss/sass.
3. EsLint to check for errors and prettier for "prettiness of the code".
4. Typescript at most, but my build had an issue where the VS Code and ESLint.

I chose to try and build it all myself without using any css frameworks, or any vue modules.
